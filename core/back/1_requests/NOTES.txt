NOTES---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Be careful, the categories_fr and categories_en files have been sorted
manually to match the keys with the correct translation.
I did not create a script (certainly complicated) to do this operation in an automated way.


POSSIBLE SOLUTION----------------------------------------------------------------------

In the idea, it would take a script that would make a google translation of each English word
from the English list, and try to make this translation match with every french word on the french list.
Since the translations are sometimes approximate, the algorithm can quickly become complex!

One solution would be to present the French categories closest to the translation to let us
choose which one really corresponds.
